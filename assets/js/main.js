      [ 'During communication, research shows that a large portion of the message is conveyed through emotional displays, with the content of the message accounting for approximately 7%. Moreover, human brains make use of these complementary emotional displays such as facial expressions, vocal expressions, and body postures to resolve any decision ambiguities and infer reliable emotion decisions. This talk will explore how computers can emulate humans by making use of visual, audio and bio-signal modalities to recognize complex emotions using variants of recurrent neural networks' ],

      [ 'How cool would it be to ask your fridge to order a pizza? As our lives become more intertwined with technology, we will increasingly be communicating with machines and devices. The most natural way to do this is through speech, which is why companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft are betting big on automatic speech recognition (ASR). But there is so much more to speech than just ASR! Speech and language is a core part of what it means to be human, and could therefore give deep (pun!) insights into how humans organise and deal with the world. My talk will consist of three parts (two of which will be rants). In the first, I will give an overview of how deep learning is used to build today\'s state-of-the-art ASR systems. The second part will be a rant about the shortcomings of focusing only on traditional ASR. I will highlight interesting new studies in the speech community addressing problems ranging from disaster tracking to using speech as a way to get insights into human cognition; I will argue that we need more of this type of research. In the third part, I will quickly highlight (and rant about) some of our own work on interesting speech problems.' ],

Although deep learning systems provide outstanding performance on many benchmark tasks, they are often data hungry; require a significant amount of computer resources; are poor at representing uncertainty; non-trivial to incorporate prior knowledge; easily fooled by adversarial examples; finicky to optimise; and are seen as uninterpretable black-boxes.',
        'Probabilistic graphical models is the current method-of-choice to address these issues. In this talk we will explore the Bayesian network which is a celebrated model for prediction under uncertainty; incorporates prior knowledge easily; used to express relational decisions (influence diagrams); and can provide powerful performance while being mindful about dataset sizes. The Bayesian network models the Bayesian paradigm which states that anything which we have uncertainty over we must maintain a distribution over.  We will explore the representation, inference, and learning of these networks as well as present some trending software which can be used to execute these powerful graphical models on real datasets.
